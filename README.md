# SwiftApiDsl

‚úÇÔ∏è A simple DSL to create `URLRequest`s and API clients concisely.

As opposed to Alamofire and friends, the goal here is to simplify common use cases and let you manage complex ones 
yourself, either by extending this lib or by directly using `URLSession` components: they're well designed enough for
libs to be useless for advanced usage.

Also retry mechanisms are out of the table. Better use 
[SwiftRetrier](https://github.com/PittsCraft/SwiftRetrier) to retry your requests easily and with full control.

## Create an API Client

All you need is a base URL

```swift
let baseUrl = URL(string: "https://google.com")!
let client = ApiClient(baseUrl: baseUrl)
```

## Use it

```swift
// Simple fetch
let profile: Profile = try await client.perform(.get("user/profile")) // `Profile` must conform to `Decodable`

// Post a JSON body
try await client.perform(.post("user/profile"), body: newProfile) // `newProfile`'s type must conform to `Encodable`

// Fetch both parsed JSON body and `HTTPURLResponse`
let (body, response): (Profile, HTTPURLResponse) = try await client.perform(.get("user/profile"))

// Fetch both `Data` body and `HTTPURLResponse`
let (dataBody, response) = try await client.perform(.get("user/profile"))

// Add multipart form data
let formData = MultipartFormDataModifier
    .withTextField(named: "id", value: "48")
    .withDataField(named: "file",
                   filename: "file.pdf",
                   data: fileData,
                   mimeType: "application/pdf")

try await client.perform(.post("form").with(formData))

// Download a file
try await client.download(get("user/bills/8"), destination: localDestinationUrl)
```

You can customize your request easily with extra arguments to `.get()`, `.post()` etc... or with `with()` modifiers
 (see below).

A number of options are available through `perform()` and `download()` functions:
-  provide custom `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder`, note that you can do this for all requests by passing them to the 
`ApiClient` constructor.
- if you provided request modifiers in the constructor, ignore them for a specific request 
using `ignoreDefaultModifiers` (see below for more information on modifiers)
- if you provided request validators in the constructor, ignore them for a specific request using 
`ignoreDefaultValidators`
- add extra validators

## Provide modifiers

Request modifiers can either be passed to an `ApiClient` constructor, or directly applied to a `Request`.

```swift
let apiModifiers = [
    HeaderModifier(value: "MyAppID", headerField: "CustomHeader")
]

let client = ApiClient(baseUrl: baseUrl, modifiers: apiModifiers)
```

In this case, the `HeaderModifier` will be applied to all requests executed by this client, except if you use 
`ignoreDefaultModifiers` argument in your `perform()` or `download()` call.

By default, no modifier is used by `ApiClient`.

You can implement your own modifiers:

```swift
// Custom modifier that adds an authentication token
class AuthModifier: RequestModifier {
    private let authProvider: AuthProvider

    func modify(_ urlRequest: inout URLRequest) async throws {
        let token = try await authProvider.authToken()
        urlRequest.setValue("Bearer \(token)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")
    }
}
```

Note that if a modifier `throws`, then the `perform()` or `download()` call executing the request will rethrow wrapping
the error.

There are also multiple `with()` modifiers to help you build your requests smoothly, applying modifiers on specific 
ones:

```swift
let request = Request
                .get("profile")
                .with(queryItems: [
                    "source": "Swift API DSL"
                ])
                .with(AuthModifier())

let profile: Profile = client.perform(request)
```

In some cases, you'll want to add specific modifiers only on some requests, but for authentication, we recommend to add
this modifier to an API client to avoid adding it explicitely to the majority of your requests, and create a separated
`ApiClient` for unauthenticated modifiers.

```swift
let commonModifiers = [
    HeaderModifier(value: "MyAppID", headerField: "CustomHeader")
]
let authModifiers = commonModifiers + [AuthModifier()]

let unauthClient = ApiClient(baseUrl: baseUrl, modifiers: commonModifiers)
let authClient = ApiClient(baseUrl: baseUrl, modifiers: authModifiers) 
```

## Provide validators

Validators will be applied after a request has been executed and can `throw` during `perform()` or `download()` calls.
The error will then be wrapped and rethrown. 

```swift
let validators = [
    HttpStatusCodeRangeValidator() // Validates HTTP status code is between 200 and 299 by default
]
let client = ApiClient(baseUrl: baseUrl, validators: validators)
```

By default, this same status code validation is used.

Validators are designed to be performed systematically except if you use `ignoreDefaultValidators`.

Implement your own validator:

```swift
class CustomValidator: ResponseValidator {

    func validate(data: Data, response: HTTPURLResponse) throws {
        guard !data.isEmpty, response.statusCode == 42 else {
            throw MyError()
        }
    }
}

```

## Provide a custom `URLSession`

```swift
let client = ApiClient(urlSession: myCustomSession, baseUrl: baseUrl)
```

By default, `URLSession.shared` is used.

The session is exposed at `client.urlSession`.

## Provide custom `JSONDecoder` and `JSONEncoder`

```swift
let client = ApiClient(baseUrl: baseUrl, jsonEncoder: MyJsonEncoder(), jsonDecoder: MyJsonDecoder())
```

## Get `URLRequest` from `Request`

`Request` is designed to be used with `ApiClient`, but you can still easily get an `URLRequest` from a `Request`:

```swift
let baseUrl = URL(string: "https://google.com")!
let urlRequest: URLRequest = request.toUrlRequest(baseUrl: baseUrl)
```

## Perform on `URLRequest` directly

The same functions `perform()` and `download()` are available that take an `urlRequest: URLRequest` as first parameter
instead of a `Request`.

```swift

let urlRequest: URLRequest

let profile: Profile = client.perform(urlRequest: urlRequest)

```

## Errors thrown by `ApiClient`

`ApiClient` throws `RequestError`s that wrap source errors helping you identifying at which stage your request failed.

It exposes the source request as well as a qualified error:

```swift
public enum ErrorWrapper: Error {
    /// Error thrown by a modifier
    case requestModifierError(Error)
    /// Error thrown when performing the actual URLRequest
    case transportError(Error)
    /// Error thrown by a validator
    case validationError(data: Data, response: HTTPURLResponse, error: Error)
    /// The URLResponse of the request is not an HTTPURLResponse ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
    case notHttpResponse(URLResponse?)
    /// Terrible inconsistency, should never happen
    case unknown(Error?)
    /// The client was deallocated during a download
    case clientDeallocated
    /// Couldn't move the downloaded file to its destination
    case downloadedFileMoveFailure(Error)
}
```

You can access both easily:

```swift
do {
    let profile = try await client.perform(.get("user/profile"))
} catch {
    let requestError = error.asRequestError
    
    let qualifiedError = requestError.error
    let request = requestError.request
    
    switch qualifiedError {
        case .transportError(let sourceError):
            print("transportError: \(sourceError.localizedDescription)")
        default:
            print("other error")
    }
    
    // Have both the request debug description and the qualified error localized description
    print(requestError.localizedDescription)
}
```
